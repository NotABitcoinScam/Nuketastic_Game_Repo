# INTRO
## Welcome to
## NUKETASTIC
(name wip...)

This is a wip game where you play as some kind of nuclear missile but the catch is that you have major anger management issues...
The gameplay consists of making your way through life's menial tasks but also trying not to explode.


Is the lady at the drive through rude when she says that they only have *small* frosties? DON'T EXPLODE!
Did the vending machine eat your money and not give you your snack? DON'T EXPLODE!

Will update this repo with code changes as often as I can

=D
